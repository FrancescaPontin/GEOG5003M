## Module format

Each week of will have a set of lecture slides to read through and a practical session to work through. The course has been designed for you to work through at your own pace. The dates proved are a guide to give you enough time to meet the assignment deadlines. By the end of Week 6 (w/c/ 16/06/25) you will have done everything you need to complete your portfolio assignment (due 24/06/25) (however half the portfolio assignment can be completed by the end of week 4).

I will return your portfolio assignment feedback in plenty of time for you to incorporate feedback into your final assessment.

## Materials

-   Notebooks for each teaching week will all be available from the start of the module on GitHub. All materials will also be available on Minerva.


## Assessment

This module consists of two assignments:

- Programming portfolio: A Portfolio of code based on course content (30%)

- Spatial data science report: A Jupyter notebook documenting the investigation and interpretation of open spatial data to gain insight which can be used for public good (70%)

See assignment briefs for more details and lecture slides.

#### Assignment templates can be found in the notebooks folder
